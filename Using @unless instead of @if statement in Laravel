#Using @unless instead of @if statement in Laravel

We all come across a this situation in which we use 

@if(!Auth::check())
Please Sign in.
@endif

In Laravel we have a better solution for this we use

@unless(Auth::check())
Please Sign in.
@endunless

We can have another example like this

@unless(count($posts)==0)
<h1>{{$post->title}}</h1>
@endunless

the expression checks if it returns FALSE and then shows the data. If the expression returns True it just ignores the inner part.
